 # Orchestration Modes
 - Scale set orchestration modes allow you to have greater control over how virtual machine instances are managed by the scale set.
 - The orchestration mode is defined when you create the scale set and cannot be changed or updated later.


# Scale Sets with Flexible Orchestration
- Optimized for high availability and scalability with identical or mixed virtual machine types.
- Flexible Orchestration is the reccomended orchestration mode when deploying scale sets in Azure.
- offering enhanced availability guarantees (up to 1,000 VMs).
- VMs are automatically distributed across Availability Zone or fault domains within a region ensuring resilience for both stateless and stateful applications.
- it allows for dynamic instance mixing, enabling the use of different VM types, as well as a combination of Spot and on-demand instances, for optimized performance and cost efficiency.
- Flexible orchestration supports all key scale set features such as **metrics-based autoscaling**, **instance protection**, **standby pools**, **upgrade policies**, and more.

# Scalet Sets with Uniform Orchestration
- Uniform Orchestration mode is optimized and ideal for large-scale workloads with identical virtual machine instances.
- Uniform orchestration ensures consistency by using a predefined virtual machine profile to deploy identical instances within a scale set.
- While some customization of individual VMs is possible, Uniform orchestration primarily manages VMs as a group.
- Uniform orchestration supports key scale set features, including **metrics-based autoscaling**, **instance protection**, and **automatic OS upgrades**.
