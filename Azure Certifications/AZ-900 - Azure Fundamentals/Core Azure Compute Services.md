# Core Azure Compute Services and Products

## What is Compute Service
- Remember that not all VM types are available in all regions, so therefore select the VM type and the region carefully. 

## Different Compute Services and Products offered by Azure

- **Azure Virtual Machines:** A service where you deploy and manage virtual machines (VMs) inside an Azure virtual network.
- Azure App Service: A managed service for hosting web apps, mobile app back ends, RESTful APIs, or automated business processes.
- Azure Function: A service that provides managed functions that run based on a variety of trigger types for event-driven applications.
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): A managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications.
- Azure Container Apps: A managed service built on Kubernetes, which simplifies the deployment of containerized applications in a serverless environment.
- Azure Container Instances: This service is a fast and simple way to run a single container or group of containers in Azure.
                             Azure Container Instances doesn't provide full container orchestration, but you can implement them without having to provision
                             any VMs or adopt a higher-level service.

# Understand different Hosting Models for Compute Services

- Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
- Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)
- Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

# Microservices Compute Option
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/design/compute-options
- The term compute refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on.
- For a microservices architecture, the following approaches are popular:
  - Deploy microservices on dedicated compute platforms, typically by using a microservice orchestrator.
  - Deploy microservices on a serverless platform.
  - Following are teh Microservices compute options and products offered by Azure:
    - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
    - Container Apps
    - Service Fabric
    - Red Hat OpenShift
